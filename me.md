![Image]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/me.png)

I am **extremely curious** which allows me to have a wide range of interests, from Electronics and IT but also through Science and Psychology.

I have a **critical mind** and I am **very imaginative** thus it leads me to come up with ways to improve, create and invent. This explains why I love **product R&D**.

I am **highly passionate** about my work, ideas and interests. I am a firm believer, sometimes stubborn but I always remain professional.

I am addicted to **team work**, and I strongly support **good communication**. As an Open-Source community inspired guy, I also strongly believe that an organized, driven and motivated group can accomplish much more.

I always force and encourage myself to **see from all points of view** and to keep an **open perspective** because I believe that if we limit ourselves to our POV, we also limit the understanding of the issue in hand.

**Nature**, **music** and **design**. Infinite sources of inspiration, influence me to be a meticulous maker in general.
