## Setup


```bash
# clone the repo into a directory named `website`
$ git clone <repo-url> website
$ cd website

# install dependencies
$ bundle

# edit `_config.yml` and other files as needed...

# serve locally
$ bundle exec jekyll s
```

The site should be live at `http://localhost:4000`. Jekyll watches and regenerates files on change.


## Usage

```bash
# create a new post
$ bundle exec jekyll post "Your new post title"
```

## Effects


> **Pulse animation**

A green dot that links to the home page pulses when the page is loaded or hovered over.

## Build and deploy


To generate static files in the `_site` directory, run:

```
$ jekyll build
```

**Automated deploy**

The `wercker.yml` files contains a job that builds and force pushes the generated `_site` files to the `master` branch on GitHub.

Usually, I keep the source on a separate branch named `source`, and let wercker handle pushing to `master`.
