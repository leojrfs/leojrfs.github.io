## Setup

To view the website locally:

```bash
# clone the repo into a directory named website
$ git clone https://github.com/nishanths/nishanths.github.io.git website
$ cd website

# make sure we are on the correct branch
$ git checkout source

# install gems
$ bundle

# Edit _config.yml and other files as needed ...

# serve locally
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

The site should be live at `http://localhost:4000`. Jekyll watches and regenerates files on change.


## Usage

To create a new post, run:

```bash
$ bundle exec jekyll post "Your new post title"
# New post created at _posts/2016-03-13-your-new-post-title.md.
```

## Build and deploy

To generate static files in the `_site` directory, run:

```
$ bundle exec jekyll build
```

**Automatic deploy**

The `wercker.yml` file contains a job that builds and force pushes the static files to the `master` branch on GitHub. I usually keep the source on a separate `source` branch and let wercker take care of pushing to `master`.
