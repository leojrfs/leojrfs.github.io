## Setup

To view the website locally:

```bash
# clone the repo into a directory named `website`
$ git clone https://github.com/nishanths/nishanths.github.io.git website
$ cd website

# install gems
$ bundle

# Edit `_config.yml` and other files as needed ...

# serve locally
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```

The site should be live at `http://localhost:4000`. Jekyll watches and regenerates files on change.


## Usage

To create a new post, run:

```bash
$ bundle exec jekyll post "Your new post title"
# New post created at _posts/2016-03-13-your-new-post-title.md.
```

## Effects


**Pulse animation**

A green dot that links to the home page pulses when the page is loaded and hovered over.

## Build and deploy


To generate static files in the `_site` directory, run:

```
$ jekyll build
```

**Automated deploy**

The `wercker.yml` files contains a job that builds and force pushes the static files to the `master` branch on GitHub. I usually keep the source on a separate `source` branch and let wercker take care of pushing to `master`.
