## Setup


```bash
# clone the repo
$ git clone <repo-url>

# edit `_config.yml` and other files as needed...

# install dependencies
$ bundle

# serve locally
$ jekyll s
```

The site should now be live at `http://localhost:4000`. Jekyll watches and regenerates files on change.


## Show me something interesting


#### Pulse animation

## Build and deploy


To generate static files in the `_site` directory, run:

```
$ jekyll build
```

#### Automated deploy

The `wercker.yml` files defines a job that builds and force-pushes the generated `_site` directed to the `master` GitHub on each commit. 

Usually, I keep the source on a separate branch named `source`, and let wercker handle pushing to `master`.
